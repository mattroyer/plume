##### Portable Lite User-Managed Environment

The goal of this project is to be able to have all of your system settings in a yaml file which feeds the software to create your settings for you in your preferred OS.

For the moment it is for a Windows environment because that's what I mainly use at work. I also have a Windows netbook at home. But also use a Mac at home, so would like to have it OS independent in the future.

This software is **very** new. I will continually rework it as much as I can. Any enhancements that can be made by contributors would be greatly appreciated. Just shoot me a pull request.
